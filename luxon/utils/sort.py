class Itemgetter:
    """itemgetter that caters for items that are 'None'

    Return a callable object that fetches the given item(s) from its operand.
    After f = itemgetter(2), the call f(r) returns r[2].
    After g = itemgetter(2, 5, 3), the call g(r) returns (r[2], r[5], r[3])

    When using itemgetter as the key when sorting, Python3 can not compare
    values to NoneTypes. This version of itemgetter returns "" whenever a
    value of None is present.
